## Project Description
In this project, I built a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  


## File Descriptions

- dog_app.ipynb - notebook for dog's breed prediction

- bottleneck_features - bottleneck features which are used in the pipeline as trasfer learning.

- images - collection of images to test our algorithm.

- saved_models - folder where models from jupyter notebook are saved
