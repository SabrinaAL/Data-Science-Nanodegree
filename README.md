Collection of Data Science Projects from Udacity Nanodegree
## 1. Insight into into childhood behavior and health problems [child_behavior_health](https://github.com/SabrinaAL/Data-Science-Nanodegree/tree/master/child_behavior_health)
   ### Description 
   Understanding relation between behavior/health problems and gender of children between 0–13 years old. 
   Questions that can be ansewered with the analysis are following:
   
- What are the five most common childhood development problems?
- How are children affected by multiple development problems?
- Is there a gender based effect among children with multiple problems?
## 2. Disaster Response Pipelines [disaster_response](https://github.com/SabrinaAL/Data-Science-Nanodegree/tree/master/disaster_response)
   ### Description 
   In this project, I analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
   The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. I created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that the messages    are send to an appropriate disaster relief agency. The project also includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification      results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data.
