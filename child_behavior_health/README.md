## Project Description
There is an evidence that infant health and development effects each gender differently I examine effects of it on older children. I analyze  boys and girls of age between 0–13 years old within group of health and childhood development problems. Health group contains following illness: Asthma, Heart, Chronic condition, Special needs, Attention problem, More medical issues, Limited ability, PT/OT (aka: special therapy, speech, physical therapy, occupational therapy and/or psychological services), IEP - Individualized Education Program for special kids, and IFSP - Individual Family Service Plan. For childhood development problem I look into the following: ADHD, Behavior, AD, ASD, Aggressive, PDD, and AS.

I primarily focus on the following questions:

- What are the five most common childhood development problems?
- How are children affected by multiple development problems? 
- Is there a gender based effect among children with multiple problems?
